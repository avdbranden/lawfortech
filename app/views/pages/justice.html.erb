      			<h4 class="book-titles">Justice Is Falling Short of Expectations</h4>
		    	<p>Technology impacts every sector of society but justice.</p>
           		<p>There is <b>a wide gap</b> between <b>how justice is provided</b> to ordinary citizens and <b>their expectations</b>. Citizens have been used to benefit from a service that is online, of a good quality, fast and affordable. Justice seems at odds with those features. Justice evolves in a paper world, is slow, expensive and quality is not always optimal.</p>
            	<p>What can be done about it? This is the question I ask in my book "Les robots Ã  l'assaut de la justice". In this essay, I argue that the way forward is to foster a <b>more efficient justice</b> i.e. a service offering a better ratio value-money-speed.</p>
