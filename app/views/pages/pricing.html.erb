				When I visit the "Our Fee" section of a business law firm, I find it hilarious how lawyers manage to stress the importance of transparency of their fees while providing absolutely no hard figures. This <b>lack of transparency</b> is not unique to the legal sector but it is certainly exacerbating the tensions between lawyers' and clients' expectations.
			</p>
			<p>
				To me though, transparency is key. 1) It allows you, the potential client, to have at least ballpark idea of how much you will pay for my services (you will see that I try to standardise most of my work). 2) It allows me to not waste time on quoting cheap clients who just want to compare prices (working for such clients does leaves me cold). Publicy displaying my rates might be risky (since "this is not an industry standard" and "lawyers woud never do that") but I am confident that doing so will <b>attract the right kind of clients</b> who value opennes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Without further ado, here is what you can expect when hiring me for the following deliverables (fees are excluding VAT).
